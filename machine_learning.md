### Math
- Linear Algebra: Fundamental to machine learning and AI. You'll need to understand vectors, matrices, tensor operations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. They are used in various aspects of ML such as neural networks, support vector machines, dimensionality reduction, etc.
- Calculus: You should have a good grasp of differential and integral calculus. Understanding concepts such as derivatives and integrals are necessary for optimization problems, understanding learning rates, and in training neural networks (backpropagation).
- Multivariable Calculus: Since many ML algorithms involve multiple variables, knowing how to perform calculus operations on them is important. Concepts such as partial derivatives and gradients are key.
- Probability Theory and Statistics: Crucial for understanding and interpreting data. Topics should include probability rules & axioms, Bayesâ€™ theorem, random variables, expectation, variance, distributions (like Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson), central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.
- Optimization: Techniques for finding the best solution to a problem, for instance, gradient descent, are heavily used in ML.
- Information Theory: Entropy, Information Gain, KL Divergence, etc., are used in various parts of ML including decision trees and in understanding learning in deep networks.
