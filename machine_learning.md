## Key concepts
- EDA | Understand the data, .shape, .columns, number of values in each columns, Make scatter plots - 2D/3D, understand the axis - labels/scale, Pair-plots, Histograms, univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, Probability distribution function (PDF), Cumulative distribution function(CDF), Mean, Variance, Standard deviation,median, percentile, quantile, Interquartile Range (IQR) & Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Median Absolute deviation, Interquartile range, Box plot, Whiskers, Violin plots, Multivariate probability density, contour
plot,

## Misc stuff that helps ML
- Space & Time complexity
