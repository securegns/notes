# Risk management
With limited amount of time and budget, risk management can be helpful for priortizing security efforts and allocate resources effectively. Identification, Assessment and prioritization risks.

### Three major steps
1. Asset valuation
    - Figure out each how valuable each asset of an orginisation is
    - Ranking assets from Low to High priority
    - Quantative and Qualitative analysis
2. Risk analysis
    - Risk associated with each asset
        - Can be done by identifying Threats, Vulnerabilities, Impact and Likelyhood
        - Threat modeling is a way to identify threats - STRIDE, PASTA and DREAD are important. STRIDE can be used to identify threats and DREAD used for prioritizing threats
        - Qualitative and Quantative analysis for ranking 
4. Risk treatment
    - Avoid(prevent), Transfer(Insurance), Mitigate(Implementing controls) and Accept
    - Residual risk - Risk left over after controls applied
    - Types of controls - 
    - 2 catagorizations of controls - Safegures(controls so risk dont occure) and Countermeasures()
#### Qualitative and Quantative analysis
###### Quantative 
- Exactly how much a risk is going to cost us per year
- ALE(Annually loss expectancy) = SLE(Single loss expectancy) x ARO(Annual rate of occurance)
- SLE = Asset value x Exposure factor(a percentage of asset loss)

###### Qualitative
- A relative ranking system
